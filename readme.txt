
I have used Java to program . 
wumpus_rules.txt file contains the rules of the wumpus world as described in the assignment. 


Compile using javac *.java, which compiles and creates the .class files. 

And to run the program :

java CheckTrueFalse wumpus_rules.txt [additional.txt] [statement.txt]
